Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968):-
The concept of software engineering was formally introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference highlighted the "software crisis", where software development faced challenges such as poor quality, cost overruns, and missed deadlines. It emphasized the need for structured methodologies, documentation, and systematic development processes.

The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s):-
In response to the software crisis, structured programming emerged as a key milestone. Proposed by Edsger Dijkstra, it promoted the use of clear control structures (loops, conditionals) and modular code instead of unstructured "spaghetti code." This approach improved code readability, maintainability, and reliability, influencing modern programming languages.

The Agile Manifesto and Modern Development Practices (2001):-
The Agile Manifesto, introduced in 2001, revolutionized software development by shifting away from rigid, document-heavy methodologies like Waterfall. Agile emphasized collaboration, adaptability, iterative development, and customer feedback, leading to popular frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. Today, Agile principles shape how software teams build and deliver software efficiently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for developing high-quality software efficiently. It consists of the following key phases:

Planning

Defines the project scope, goals, risks, budget, and timeline.
Involves feasibility analysis to determine whether the project is viable.
Requirement Analysis

Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements.
Engages stakeholders to ensure the software meets business needs.
Design

Creates system architecture, database design, and user interface models.
Establishes technical specifications for developers to follow.
Implementation (Coding & Development)

Developers write the actual source code based on the design.
Uses programming languages, frameworks, and development tools.
Testing

Identifies and fixes bugs to ensure functionality, security, and performance.
Includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Deployment

Releases the software to users in a production environment.
Can be done in phases (e.g., beta release, full deployment).
Maintenance & Support

Provides updates, bug fixes, and enhancements.
Ensures long-term functionality and performance.
Each phase plays a crucial role in ensuring that software is developed effectively, meets user expectations, and remains sustainable over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile are two distinct software development methodologies with different approaches. Waterfall follows a sequential and linear process, where each phase—such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment—must be completed before moving to the next. It is rigid and less flexible, making changes difficult once a phase is finalized. Customer involvement is minimal, as requirements are gathered at the beginning, and testing is done only after development is completed. This approach is best suited for large, well-defined projects with clear requirements, such as banking systems, healthcare software, or aerospace applications, where compliance and security are crucial.

On the other hand, Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing for continuous improvements and adaptations throughout the development process. Work is divided into short cycles called sprints, where testing and stakeholder feedback occur frequently. Agile encourages high customer involvement, making it ideal for projects where requirements may change over time. This methodology is well-suited for fast-paced environments such as mobile app development, e-commerce websites, or any project requiring constant updates and improvements. While Waterfall is effective for structured, high-risk, and long-term projects, Agile is more appropriate for dynamic, customer-driven, and rapidly evolving software development needs.
